## üöÄ Update

## V3
Hello everyone! 

We've decided to make a final change to our shortcut, as the cost associated with using our API has become too much. We are sad to announce that this means we will no longer be using our API in the shortcut, however it is still available for use. To ensure you can continue to use this shortcut, we have added some instructions on how to use your own API instead. 

We'd like to thank you all for understanding and we look forward to working with you all again on more projects in the future. Thank you!

v2
  With this update, we've increased the maximum character limit of your shortcut from 300 to 500 words 
We have improved the display of saved texts to make them more clear and easy to read. 
V3
This upgrade fix for a bug related to saving and exiting ,takes text results from 550 words up to 700 words, making it an even more powerful tool for anyone who wants quick and easy access to bilingual communication and text processing capabilities.
